RTL8852AE+AX201 provides Wi-Fi 6 experience. However, because this set of things is relatively new, the driver has not been incorporated into the kernel, so it needs to compile the kernel module to support it.\\n\\nLet $f\\\\colon[a,b] \\\\to \\\\R$ be Riemann integrable. Let $F\\\\colon[a,b]\\\\to\\\\R$ be $F(x)=\\n\\\\int_{a}^{x} f(t)\\\\,dt$. Then $$F$$ is continuous, and at all $x$ such that $f$ is continuous at $x$, $F$ is differentiable at $x$ with $F\'(x)=f(x)$.\\n\\nActually, the developer of RealTek has submitted the driver patch to Linux, but the code has not been incorporated into the kernel.\\nLook at this patch https://lwn.net/ml/Linux-wireless/202012301527.izlr86em-lkp @ intel.com/\\nhttps://patches.linaro.org/cover/463567/\\n\\nYou can see that the folder rtw89 does not exist in the kernel. This folder should be/drivers/net/wireless/realtek/RTW 89.\\nhttps://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.15-rc6/source/drivers/net/wireless/realtek\\n\\nGood people in the community have changed rtw89 v5 to dkms kernel module.\\nhttps://github.com/lwfinger/rtw89\\n\\nBy following the README of rtw89, a kernel module can be compiled and installed in the system.\\n\\nThe solution is the simplest in arch system, and the warehouse rtw89-dkms-git already exists in AUR."}]}')}}]);
