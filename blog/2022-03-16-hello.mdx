$f(x)$

RTL8852AE is a network card model that Lenovo's notebook and desktop computers like to use. RTL8852AE+AX201 provides Wi-Fi 6 experience. However, because this set of things is relatively new, the driver has not been incorporated into the kernel, so it needs to compile the kernel module to support it.

Let $f\colon[a,b] \to \R$ be Riemann integrable. Let $F\colon[a,b]\to\R$ be $F(x)=
\int_{a}^{x} f(t)\,dt$. Then $$F$$ is continuous, and at all $x$ such that $f$ is continuous at $x$, $F$ is differentiable at $x$ with $F'(x)=f(x)$.

Actually, the developer of RealTek has submitted the driver patch to Linux, but the code has not been incorporated into the kernel.
Look at this patch https://lwn.net/ml/Linux-wireless/202012301527.izlr86em-lkp @ intel.com/
https://patches.linaro.org/cover/463567/

You can see that the folder rtw89 does not exist in the kernel. This folder should be/drivers/net/wireless/realtek/RTW 89.

Good people in the community have changed rtw89 v5 to dkms kernel module.
https://github.com/lwfinger/rtw89

By following the README of rtw89, a kernel module can be compiled and installed in the system.

The solution is the simplest in arch system, and the warehouse rtw89-dkms-git already exists in AUR.
